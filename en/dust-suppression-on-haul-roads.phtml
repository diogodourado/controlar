                <p>Controlling particulate matter emissions on haul roads and industrial pathways.</p>

                <p>The haul road and industrial pathway spraying system developed by Controlar is an automated solution designed to control particulate matter emissions in these environments.</p>
                
                <p>This solution focuses on reducing investment costs, maintenance costs, and operational costs while maintaining the same quality and effectiveness required for airborne particulate containment.</p>
                
                <p>This system eliminates the need for water trucks for road wetting, making the proposed automated system highly effective and efficient.</p>

                <h2 class="big">OPERATION:</h2>
                <p>The road humidification system consists of a water reservoir, a set of motor pumps, spray nozzles, and pipelines. It is fully automated through an electronic control unit. This system is highly efficient as it eliminates the need for water trucks, significantly reducing water and energy consumption, and consequently lowering operational costs.</p>
                
                <p>The sprayers operate independently, meaning each sector can be programmed separately. These are currently the most widely used sprayers in high-precision systems, ensuring that the system's flow rate always corresponds to the most effective and balanced condition. They allow for multiple activation points within a system, following the principle of efficient flow management. Additionally, they offer great flexibility to meet specific system needs.</p>
